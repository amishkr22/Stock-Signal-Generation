# Stock-Signal-Generation
The Stock Signal Generation project wants to implement a Python-based system of generating buy and sell signals for stocks from various technical indicators. These messages can prompt traders and investors to make deliberate decisions regarding the buying, selling, or holding of stocks.
Users will run the main Python script output to signaling generation from beginning to end. The developed system gets stock data, cleans it, generates signals, calculates profit/loss, stores results in the database and visualizes trading signals.
